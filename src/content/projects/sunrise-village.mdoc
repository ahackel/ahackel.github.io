One day you get a letter from your grandfather asking for help. A strange stone circle appeared in the peaceful world of Sunrise Village. Buildings got entangled in thorny vines and everything got covered in a mysterious thick fog.

Seems like it all leads back to an ancient tale about legendary crafters creating six magical crystals to harness the elemental energy â€“ will you be able to find them? Hurry up and help your grandfather to restore the Village and solve its mysteries!
