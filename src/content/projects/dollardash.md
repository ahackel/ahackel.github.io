Dollar Dash is multiplayer fun action game. We created this game in our own little company Candygun Games with a team of only five members. Dollar Dash was released on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.

As Art Director I worked on the visual concept design and created many of the 3D models, textures, shaders and effects.
